CodeConsole

My own toolset to make console interaction in C# much more neat and fancy.

This includes:
- A bunch of helper functions (`ConsoleUtils` class, to simplify colorful output and something other stuff);
- ScriptBench - a simple, though powerful console code editor with custom highlighting support.
  + `ISyntaxHighlighter` interface is also for that purpose.
